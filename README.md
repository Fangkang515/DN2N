# Release notes:
**As we are still pushing forward with other things, the code of DN2N is expected to be released by the end of November.** 
During this period, if you have any questions (such as hoping to compare with our method or technical details), please feel free to contact me via email: skfang@buaa.edu.cn, and I will do my best to provide corresponding assistance.


#### DN2N is a generalizable scheme for 3D scene editing. Please see our [Project Website](http://sk-fun.fun/DN2N/) for video display.
